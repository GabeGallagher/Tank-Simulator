# Tank Simulator

Open world head-2-head tank fight with simple AI, terrain, and advanced control system in UE4

This game is part of the Complete Unreal Creator course on Udemy. In my opinion, it is one of the best courses on the web for learning and practicing making games with UE4 and C++.

This is some of the code I wrote while going through the lessons in the course. The end goal of the game is to drive your tank and use the terrain to your advantage to vanquish your foe, which may be an AI tank or a friend.
